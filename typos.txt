page 14, line 5: you might want to use \bigoplus
page 15, line -17: it's better to use "\ " after an abbreviation, but this is nitpicky
page 17, line -3: indexed instead of index
page 18, line -18: example instead of examples (or show instead of shows)
page 20, line -4: the spelling of square-zero is inconsistent
page 21, line 8: the exercise is 1.I, not 1.H
page 21, line -18: in the commutative diagram, Y_0'\to Y' is i, not a
page 21, line -16: i is the closed embedding, not a
page 21, line -13: the diagonal is |\Delta|
page 21, line -3: the exercise is 1.I, not 1.H
page 22, line 4: you use both composite and composition, but this is nitpicky
page 22, proposition 1.3.5: the condition for resp. is missing (i.e. the iff for formally Ã©tale)
page 22, line -18: you might want to use \bigcup
page 22, line -14: again \bigcup
page 22, line -14: you might want to say that it is an open covering of affines
page 22, line -13: statement, not corollary
page 22, line -5: Cech is missing an accent
page 27, line 10: shouldn't it be the restriction of \Omega_{X/Y}^1 to U? it is nitpicky on the notation
page 27, line -7: you might want to refer to 1.3.6(ii), not just 1.3.6, again, nitpicky
page 28, line 8: fully instead of full
page 28, line -12: again \bigcup
page 29, line 6: polynomials instead of polynomaisl
page 29, definition 1.3.5: wouldn't it be better to write the morphism Spec k\to X as plain x, not \overline{x}, because you later on say that O_{X,\overline{x}} becomes an O_{X,x}-algebra, but plain x is not defined, this would also mean changing the x's in the text
page 31, line -11: there is a superfluous space after functors
page 32, line 14: the op for opposite category is inconsistent: it should be in roman font, but sometimes it is not (e.g. here)
page 32, line -17: again \bigcup
page 32, line -14: exercise 1.K instead of exercise 1.J
page 33, line 1: again \bigcup
page 33, line -13: superfluous again
page 33, line -6: again \bigcup
page 34, line -10: again \bigcup
page 34, lines -6, -4, -2: you might want to index over i,j, not ij?
page 36, line 2: nitpicky, but you haven't identified the notation for schemes and representable functors, so it should be h_{Spec(R)}
page 36, lines 5, 12: singleton seems to be more in use that unital set?
page 37, line 11: the example is not really an example, more a remark
page 37, line -9: the morphism f should be quasi-projective, not quasi-compact and separated
page 38, line 14: it is not clear to us why we prove that f is flat over the generic point, because it is not used explicitly later on, and if you need it somehow, the "so" on line 14 should be a "because" (as right now the phrase suggests one is proving that U is dense, but this is used to prove that f is flat over the generic point!)
page 40, line -17: ) missing in the equation (middle term of the sequence)
page 40, line -12: the a_0 should be a y_0

Saturday January 24
-------------------
page 42, line -10: accent missing on Cech
page 43, line 1: again \bigcup
page 43, line -5: again \bigcup
page 43, line -1: again \bigcup
page 44, example 2.1.12: it might be useful to mention that all maps are always etale in this situation?
page 46, line -6: denoting the second left adjoint by F^a might not be optimal
page 47, line 4: maybe there should be {} around the things inside the tuple
page 50, line 2: the reference to the appendix looks a bit awkward, maybe explicitly refer to A.5 too
page 50, line 3: I think you want to denote f=(f^*,f_*,\varphi) if you wish to stick to the convention introduced in the appendix, with the left adjoint coming first
page 56, line 10: maybe explicitly say it's the small site?
page 56, line -11: it should be finite products, not all products
page 64, lemma 2.4.18: the ()'s for e^* in the Cech complex notation have been dropped multiple times
page 65, line 6: multi-index instead of multiindex
page 65, line 12: you might want to say theorem 8.3.8, as there's multiple 8.3.8's in Weibel (also an exercise)
page 66, line 11: superfluous the

Friday February 6
-----------------
page 73, line 11: espace is without the accent
page 74, line -16: p:F\to C is a category fibered over C, not a fibered category (because that is only defined a few lines later)
page 76, line -15: fully instead of full (I will stop saying this from now on)
page 87, line 14: you are missing the compositions (maybe intentional, but it is certainly not consistent, and pervades the rest of the book from this point on)
page 90, line -4: respectively instead of respetively
page 91, line 12: you might want to write i instead of \imath to keep up with the notation introduced in 3.4.4
page 93, line -9: maybe switch p_1 and p_2 to stay consistent with (4.1.6.1)
page 98, line 15: the notation for F(f:X->Y) is inconsistent, compare e.g. to page 100, line 2, where the kerning and the arrow is different, maybe because of the use of a \longarrow and \overset?
page 99, line -16: do you want to use the word covering here? at this point it is an arbitrary morphism, not necessarily something related to the topology?
page 103, line 11: maybe fppf topology is better than fppf-topology?
page 105, line 7: the reduction is to a direct sum of copies of O_S, not O
page 106, line 10: sheaves instead of sheaf
page 107, line -13: earlier you wrote Zar instead of zar
page 112, line 3: you are missing a \otimes N in the exponent?

Thursday February 13
--------------------
page 103, line -9: Mod_Y should be Mod_X
page 105, line 9: the notation \Gamma(C,G) is not clear, do you mean \Gamma(S,G) with S being the final object in the category C that we are using all along?
page 106, line 7: pairs instead of pair
page 106, line 17: we were confused by the reduction to qcqs, as there is no explicit reference to the fact that only then direct images preserve coherence, and that this is used implicitly in 4.2.11 when applying it to QCOH
page 110, line -16: the morphisms are proper *and* flat, not just proper
page 111, line 14: it is not at all clear that E' is a locally free sheaf (the result is EGA III.7.9.10), which requires the missing flatness condition, and the result is not something that we consider obvious
page 112, line 3: \otimes N missing in the definition of the E_i
